# LogicGate

### Objective
1. Given a primitive gate (Nand).
2. Implementing elementary logic gate (And, Or, Not).
3. Scale up to Mux, DMux gate.
4. Advance to multi-bit gates (And16, Not16)
5. Advance to multi-way gates (Mux8Way16, etc)


### Layout of the gate

### Approach 
* Implement using HDL languages (Verilog)
* Testing using HardwareSimulator.hd
* Debug and Finish
* Output

### Navigation
The file **01** contains the implementation for all of the gates. **Asset** file is just served for illustrative purpose. These gates have been implemented and tested correctly with the HardWaresimulator.
